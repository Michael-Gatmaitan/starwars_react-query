# Data fetching using React-query

This little project is all about informations about star wars' Planets, Spaceships, Vehicles, People, Films and Species.

But I only use in API is the planets. This project is just to solidify my knowledge on fetching a data specially using react-query.

Check Star Wars' API [here](https://swapi.dev/)

## WHat is React-query?

React Query is often described as the missing data-fetching library for React, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications a breeze.

Check the [docs](https://react-query.tanstack.com/quick-start) of react-query here for more information.
